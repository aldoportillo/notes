# Latency and Throughput

## Latency

How long it takes data to traverse a system.

Examples:

Reading 1MB from RAM: 0.25 ms
Reading 1MB from SSD: 1.00 ms

Transfer 1MB over Network: 10.00 ms

Reading 1MB over HDD: 20.00 ms
Inter-Continental Round Trip: 150.00 ms

## Throughput

How much work a computer can do in a given amount of time.

Measured in queries/second

How many requests can the server accept per second or how many bits can a server let through at a given second.

Sometimes we need to increase throughput to make a server perform better or just add more servers to accept those requests.

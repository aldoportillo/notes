# Prerequisites for Machine Learning

Understanding machine learning requires a foundation in certain key concepts and mathematical tools. Below is an overview of the essential terms and mathematical knowledge needed.

## Key Terms

### Examples

- **Definition**: Pairs of features and corresponding labels used for training a machine learning model.
- **Importance**: The foundation of machine learning algorithms; they learn to predict labels from features.

### Features

- **Definition**: Quantitative or qualitative attributes or properties that describe an observation. These can be binary (yes/no), categorical (like color), continuous (measurements), or ordinal (ranked).
- **Importance**: Features are the input variables that the model uses to make predictions.

### Labels

- **Definition**: The output or the response variable that a model is trying to predict. They can be discrete (like categories) or continuous (like temperature).
- **Importance**: Labels are what the model is trained to predict, based on the features.

## Mathematical Concepts

### Arrays and Vectors

- **Arrays**: Collections of elements (numbers, symbols, etc.), often used to store data in different dimensions.
- **Vectors**: A type of array, typically one-dimensional, representing quantities with both magnitude and direction.

### Matrix and Operations

- **Matrix (2D Array)**: A two-dimensional array of numbers.
  - **Multiplication**: Combining two matrices to produce a third matrix.
  - **Inverse**: A matrix that, when multiplied with the original matrix, yields an identity matrix.
  - **Transpose**: Flipping a matrix over its diagonal, switching the row and column indices.

### Polynomials

- **Linear Equation (Line)**:
$$
y = mx + b 
$$

- **Quadratic Equation**: 
$$
 y = ax^2 + bx + c 
 $$

### Calculus

- **Derivatives**: Measures how a function changes as its input changes, crucial for optimization in machine learning.

### Probability

- **Basics**: Understanding of random events, their likelihood, and outcomes.
- **Conditional Probability**: Probability of an event given that another event has occurred.
- **Distributions**: Models to describe how probabilities are distributed over different outcomes.
  - **Gaussian Distribution**: Represents continuous data that clusters around a mean.
  - **Uniform Distribution**: All outcomes are equally likely, such as rolling a dice.
  - **Beta Distribution**: Useful for modeling probabilities of probabilities, often used for conversion rates in A/B testing.

These foundational concepts are crucial for delving into machine learning, as they underpin the algorithms and techniques used in the field.

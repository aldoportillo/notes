# Storage

A database is used to store (write, set, record) data and retrieve (read, get, query) data.

A database is just a server.

## Persistent Storage

Any form of storage that persists if the process in charge of managing it dies.

## Disk

If data is written to disk and server reboots, the data will still be there.

## Memory

If data is stored in memory and server reboots, the data will be gone.

Reading and writing to memory is faster.
